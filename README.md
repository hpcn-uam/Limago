# Limago 100GbE Ethernet framework with TCP/IP support

**This repository is no longer active, we refer you to https://github.com/fpgasystems/fpga-network-stack**

## Introduction

This repository puts together all the necessary pieces to generate Limago.

Make sure you are using `Vivado 2018.3 IP Build 2404404`. It seems to be a bug in Vivado 2018.3.1 IP Build 2486929 that produces combinational loops in the synthesized HLS. 

*Before generating any project check each submodule's README.md to verify that everything is set properly*

## Supported Boards

So far [VCU118](https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/vcu118.html#hardware), [Alveo U200](https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/alveo/u200.html#specifications) and [Alveo U280](https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/alveo/u280.html#specifications) are supported. 

- Please check [README.md](submodules/cmac/README.md) of the CMAC wrapper to verify clock frequency for VCU118.
- The clock Frequency of the Alveo U200 can be configured using two pins, and the project already supports it.
> **_NOTE:_**  Please double check that pin D32 is driven to `0` before programming Alveo U280 [AR# 72926](https://www.xilinx.com/support/answers/72926.html)

## Cloning the repository

In order to clone this repository you need `git lfs` installed. 

This repository uses submodules and `git lfs`, check [Installing Git Large File Storage](https://help.github.com/en/articles/installing-git-large-file-storage) to install it.

```
git clone git@github.com:hpcn-uam/Limago.git --recursive
```

## How to build the projects

<details>
<summary>Click to show</summary>

The process is fully automated.

1. The first part consist on generating the necessary IP-Cores
    
    ```sh
    make ips
    ```

1. Generate Vivado Project.

    a. Check available projects
    ```sh
    make help
    ```

    b. Create Project
    ```sh
    make create_prj_vcu118-fns-single-toe-iperf
    ```

    Once the project is create you can open it. The projects are created under the folder `projects/<project_name>`

    For instance, you can open the project with Vivado:

    ```sh
    vivado projects/vcu118-fns-single-toe-iperf/vcu118-fns-single-toe-iperf.xpr
    ```

1. Implement a project 

    You can either launch it manually from the GUI or using the following command:

    ```sh
    make implement_prj_vcu118-fns-single-toe-iperf
    ```

    *It is suggested to close the GUI when launching this command.*

## How to test if the design works

### Check Physical Link

Once the FPGA has been programmed you can check if the link is up using the VIO (vio\_cmac\_synq\_0) within `Interfaces` hierarchy , the signal `cmac_sync_0_cmac_aligned_sync` must value '1'. 

![vioLink](images/vioLink.jpg)
 
If the board is attached through PCIe, the link can be checked using the `cmac_stats` program within the [Software](Software/) folder. In order to perform this, after programming the FPGA a host reboot is mandatory so as to enumerate the PCIe devices to detect the XDMA (PCIe rescan has not been tested). Check [README.md](Software/README.md) to download and install the driver. Execute `cmac_stats` and you will get the stats of the CMAC and the Tx and Rx status.

### Check Network Link

By default Limago IP address is 192.168.0.5, network mask 255.255.255.0 and its MAC address is 00:0a:35:02:9d:e5

Once you have configured your HOST with a proper IP address in the same subnetwork as Limago you can use `arping` and `ping` to reach Limago.

```sh
arping -I <interface_name> 192.168.0.5
ping 192.168.0.5
```

![ping](images/ping.png)

### Check application

#### Echo application

This section describes how to test the echo application, valid for the project(s): `vcu118-fns-single-toe-echo` 

In this case the Limago only echoes the payload of the connection to the port 15000, therefore you can use `telnet` or `ncat` to test it.

#### Iperf2 application

This section describes how to test the `iperf` (version 2) application, valid for the project(s): `vcu118-fns-single-toe-iperf` and `alveou200-fns-single-toe-iperf`

In this case, the FPGA can work both as a client and as a server. Make sure that you have installed `iperf` (version 2) in the server machine.

- FPGA as a server, which means the FPGA just gets data. By default the FPGA is listening to the range of ports between 5000 to 5063, therefore you can target any of those ports. Run the following code in the server with the NIC connected to Limago.

```sh
iperf -c 192.168.0.5 -t 10 -i 1 -p 5011 --mss 1408 -e
```

![hwServer](images/iperfClient.png)

- FPGA as a client, which means Limago opens the TCP connection and sends the data. Therefore, the HOST machine needs to communicate with Limago using the XDMA driver. Run the following code in the HOST machine attached to the FPGA: 

First of all, the server machine must run `iperf` (version 2) a as server `iperf -s -i 1`. After that, you you can run the iperf application from the FPGA as a client.

```sh
sudo ./bin/hw_iperf2 -c <server_ip_address> -t 10 -p 5001 -e
```
